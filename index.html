       About Me
     </h2>
     <p> <!-- to edit -->
      Hi there, I'm Janice! 
      
      I'm a self-driven undergraduate studying Data Science and Computer Science at <a id="link" href="https://www.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">University of California, Berkeley</a> (Go Bears üêª!), with interests in software development/data science, startups, and design. 
      <!-- I'm a software developer and a hackathon enthusiast in the Bay Area.-->
      My expected graduation date is December 2023. My philosophy when developing software is to write code and design solutions with empathy and purpose to improve user experiences.
      <br></br>
      I'm very passionate about achieving gender equity in tech, connecting communities together, and creating accessible & impactful tech for everyone. 
     <!--Some areas in tech that I would like to explore are healthtech, media, and communication/information. -->
      As a hackathon enthusiast and advocate for accessible education, I've been to 10+ hackathons and have organized 3 to date. I use she/her pronouns.

     </h2>
    <p>
     Organized <a id="link" href="https://swe.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">SWE</a>'s <a id="link" href="https://swe.berkeley.edu/miniu"  target="_blank">Mini University</a> Event for Bay Area high schoolers to explore a day in the life of a Berkeley Engineering student through lab tours, hands-on workshops, and panels.
     <br></br>
     Interned at <a id="link" href="https://www.expedia.com/" target="_blank">Expedia Group</a> on the Mobile App Engineering Team. 
     <br></br>
     In high school, I lead my Girls Who Code club, wrote articles for my school newspaper, and organized the first iteration of <a id="link" href="http://aihacks.org/" target="_blank">AIHacks</a>, the first all-female hackathon in Southern California with a emphasis on AI. 
Striving to empower students with special needs and increase their accessibility in sports, I joined a team 
of students, the <a id="link" href="https://lemelson.mit.edu/teams/inventeam/79" target="_blank">DHS InvenTeam</a>, to invent and build a device enable these students to participate in the annual Special Olympics in my local community.
