       About Me
     </h2>
     <p> <!-- to edit -->
      Hey, I'm Janice! 
      
      I'm a self-driven sophomore studying computer science at UC Berkeley (Go Bears üêª!), with interests in software dev, product, data science, entrepreneurship, and design. 
      /<!-- I'm a software developer, aspiring product manager, and a hackathon enthusiast in the Bay Area.-->
      As a software developer and aspiring product manager, I write code and design solutions with empathy and purpose to improve experiences.
      
      I'm very passionate about achieving gender equity in tech and creating accessible tech for everyone. Some areas in tech that I would like to explore are healthtech, media, and communication/information. 
      As a hackathon enthusiast, I've been to 10+ hackathons and have organized 3 to date.
