     <h2>
       About Me
     </h2>
     <p> <!-- to edit -->
      Hey, I'm Janice! 
      
      I'm a self-driven sophomore studying computer science at UC Berkeley (Go Bears üêª!), with interests in software dev, product, data science, entrepreneurship, and design. 
      <!-- I'm a software developer, aspiring product manager, and a hackathon enthusiast in the Bay Area.-->
      As a software developer and aspiring product manager, I write code and design solutions with empathy and purpose to improve experiences.
     
      I'm very passionate about achieving gender equity in tech and creating accessible tech for everyone. Some areas in tech that I would like to explore are healthtech, media, and communication/information. 
      As a hackathon enthusiast, I've been to 10+ hackathons and have organized 3 to date.
     </p>

       What I've Been Up To
     </h2>

    <h3>This Summer.</h3>

    <p>
     ‚Ä¢ Event Planner at <a href="https://www.sospectra.com" target="_blank">Spectra</a>. Organizing virtual, beginner-friendly hackathon for students & young professionals who identify as underrepresented genders in tech (female/non-binary). 
     Focusing on helping hackers learn tangible skills and giving them a comfortable environment to experiment. 
     <!--
     Spectra is all about creating a safe and inviting environment for those who identify as female or other underrepresented genders in the tech space. We focus on learning new skills and connecting with like-minded people to help these young participants advance themselves in the tech world.
     Spectra believes it's important to host events like these to help students and new grads get comfortable using skills they've learned to make their cool and creative ideas tangible.
     Focusing on quality of hackers' experience rather than  quantity?-->
     <br></br>
     ‚Ä¢ Developing a product to tackle rising issues in media, particularly fake news and information bias, through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/productbuds" target="_blank">Product Buds</a>' initiative for aspiring PMs, <a href="https://productbuds.devpost.com/" target="_blank">Project Jam</a>.
       Researching how people in the U.S. and globally consume news. 
     </p>

     <h3>Life.</h3>
   <p>
     ‚Ä¢ Watching NYC Media Lab x Bloomberg's <a href="https://www.nycmedialab.org/upcoming-events/machines2020" target="_blank">Machines + Media</a> series on examining how emerging technologies, such as AI and computer vision, are changing all aspects of media (production, distribution, consumption). Evaluating the impact of these technologies on society.
    <br></br>
     ‚Ä¢ Discovering new podcasts. Curating new music playlists on YouTube. Experimenting with creating my own AR Instagram filters
     </p>
     
    <h2>
        What I've Done
     </h2>
    <p>
     This past spring, I organized SWE's Mini University Event.
     <br></br>
     Last summer, I interned at Expedia Group on the Mobile App Engineering Team. 
     <br></br>
     In high school, I lead my Girls Who Code club, editted my school newspaper, <a href="https://thedublinshield.com/" target="_blank">The Dublin Shield</a>, and organized <a href="http://aihacks.org/" target="_blank">AIHacks</a>, the first all-female hackathon in Southern California with a emphasis on AI. Striving to empower students with special needs and increase their accessibility in sports, I joined a team 
of students, the <a href="https://lemelson.mit.edu/teams/inventeam/79">DHS InvenTeam</a>, to invent and build a device enable these students to participate in the annual Special Olympics in my local community.
